## Guide to Mumble server (murmur) on FreeNAS/TrueNAS
### Intro

Discord is currently the most popular voice chat system among many communities, however they are a closed source platform, do not offer end to end encryption, and frequently engage in censorship. 

The mumble server, [called murmur](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Running_Murmur) offers us complete, uncensorable control of our voice chat community. Mumble offers end to end encryption, and a very powerful Access Control List ruleset that allows you to give special permissions to your users. ACLs are a little hard to udnerstand at first, so at the end of the guide there is a basic ACL configuration example to get you started.
