## Guide to ‚Çøitcoin & ‚ö°LightningÔ∏è‚ö° on ü¶àFreeNASü¶à

Running `lnd' from the command line is exhausting, lets get a pretty user interface going!

### Install RTL
Find the latest release [here](https://github.com/ShahanaFarooqui/RTL/releases).

If not already there, SSH into your freenas box and switch to your bitcoin jail.

```
# pkg install node npm python cairo
# cd /home/bitcoin
# git clone https://github.com/ShahanaFarooqui/RTL.git
# cd RTL
# npm install
```
Once the install is complete, create a RTL.conf configuration file:
```
# nano RTL.conf
```
Add the following lines, make sure to set `rtlPass=`:
```
[Authentication]
lndServerUrl=https://localhost:8082/v1
macroonPath=/home/bitcoin/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet
nodeAuthType=CUSTOM
rtlPass=pickapassword
lndConfigPath=/home/bitcoin/.lnd/lnd.conf
[Settings]
flgSidenavOpened=true
flgSidenavPinned=true
menu=Vertical
menuType=Regular
theme=dark-blue
satsToBTC=false
```
Save (CTRL+O,ENTER) then exit (CTRL+X)

### Configure Autostart
```
# nano /usr/local/etc/rc.d/RTL
```
Add the following lines:
```
#!/bin/sh
#
# PROVIDE: RTL
# REQUIRE: bitcoind lnd
# KEYWORD:

. /etc/rc.subr
name="RTL"
rcvar="RTL_enable"
RTL_command="/usr/local/bin/node /home/bitcoin/RTL/rtl"
pidfile="/var/run/${name}.pid"
command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-u bitcoin -P ${pidfile} -r -f ${RTL_command}"

load_rc_config $name
: ${lnd_enable:=no}

run_rc_command "$1"
```
Save (CTRL+O,ENTER) then exit (CTRL+X)

Make the service script executable:
```
# chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/RTL
```
Enable in `etc/rc.conf'
```
# nano /etc/rc.conf
```
Append the following line:
```
service RTL_enable="YES"
```
Save (CTRL+O,ENTER) then exit (CTRL+X)

Give it a run!
```
# service RTL start
```

Now connect on your web browser at the jail ip:3000

Its been my experience that RTL will hang with the spinning animation, especially after unlocking the wallet, just close the browser window and open a new window and it should go away.

### Quick brief on lightning channels...
Play around with the interface. You can either configure `lnd` to run on [autopilot](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/sample-lnd.conf), or make connections yourself. LND has its own layer 1 wallet, Click `LND Wallet`, select an `Address Type`, and click `Generate Address`. This wallet will need funds sent to it to create lightning channels. Wait for your transaction to confirm...

### Add a Peer
This step does not commit funds, it just makes a conneciton to the network.

Click on `Peers`, then type an address under `Add Peer`. You can select a peer on www.1ML.com, or connect to my node:
```
023ec3d1fa35f7fb8996374cf1848c1a40788df013551c5510c75617222bd2dd2d@68.234.70.195:9735
```

### Add a Channel
Now lets make our first channel. Click on `Channels`, select your peer's `Alias`, and select how many satoshis you want to commit. Click `Open`. Wait for your transaction to confirm on the blockchain.


### Managing Channels & Check Balances
In RTL's web-ui, click on channels. All of your inbound and outbound connections are listed here. The most you can receive is under the `Remote Balance` column. The most you can send is under the `Local Balance`. So after making your first channel, you can send, but not receive.

If you make a channel for 100,000 satoshis, and spend 40,000 satoshies, that channel now has a `Local Balance` (spending) of 60,000 and `Remote Balance` of 40,000 (receiving). Total `Local Balance` + `Remote Balance` capacity can not exceed the channel `Capacity`.

Right now it is not possible to send or receive a payment over multiple channels. This future feature is called [Atomic Multipath Payments](https://medium.com/coinmonks/specific-fee-routing-for-multi-path-payments-in-lightning-networks-b0e662c79819), which isn't implemented, yet.

### Spend Some Satoshis!
So go ahead and spend some satoshis! Copy a payment request from a website or service. In RTL's web-ui, click `payments`, and paste lightning invoices in, and click `send payment`.

Give https://www.lightningspin.com/ a spin (its really slick after you install the Joule plugin), give someone a tip on https://tippin.me, read a https://yalls.org/ article. Enjoy instantaneous and off chain transactions!

If you make a channel to me, [contact me](README.md) and I will make a channel back, so you have outbound and inbound capacity!

Over time it is likely you will get inbound connections. Make sure your node is always online, and wallet unlocked.

### Upgrade RTL
```
# service RTL stop
# cd /home/bitcoin/RTL
# git reset --hard HEAD
# git clean -f -d
# git pull
# npm install
# service RTL start
```
