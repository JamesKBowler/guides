### My Extras

#### [Run LND on clearnet](https://github.com/seth586/guides/blob/master/OpenWRT/upnp_natpmp.md)
Don't have a static IP address? `lnd` will loose peer connections unless you configure `nat=true` and have a working UPnP implementation. This is a process to ensure your UPnP implementation is secure.

#### [Manually compile bitcoind](extras/compile_bitcoind.md)
Some situations require you to compile directly from source code.  

#### [Electrs: Electrum Server in Rust](extras/electrs.md)
This is a fully indexed Electrum Server. It adds +40GB or so, but can look up any address or xpub, whereas Electrum Personal Server is lightweight, but only indexes addresses and xpubs you specify.

#### [Tor relay node](extras/torrelay.md) 
Tor doesn't give anonymity or sufficient bandwidth unless there are enough volunteer relays helping the network. Lets give back!

### Mobile Wallets for Android over Tor Hidden Service
Connect securely, privately, and anonymously to your home node wherever you are in the world!

#### [SoftEther VPN in a FreeNAS jail](https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/alternative-to-openvpn-softether-vpn.47395/)
Want to use a mobile lightning wallet away from your home network? Set up a VPN server at home, so you can securely connect to your `lnd` on the road! SoftEther offers a free DNS service, great option if your ISP changes your home IP address on you!
